## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2018-07-11
### Added

- `DRAMATIQ_ENCODER` setting.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-04-14
### Added

- `DramatiqTestCase`

## [0.2.2] - 2018-01-06
### Fixed

- `--path` is now the first to be passed to `dramatiq`.  This fixes an
  issue where the workers wouldn't boot when the `-no-reload` flag was
  set.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-01-06
### Added

- `--path` command line argument.

### Changed

- The broker is now set up by `DjangoDramatiqConfig.ready`.
- The minimum dramatiq version is now 0.18.
- `BASE_DIR` is no longer a required setting.

### Fixed

- `Task.message` no handles `memoryview`s properly.

## [0.1.5] - 2017-12-22
### Fixed

- Python 3.5 is now supported.

## [0.1.4] - 2017-12-08
### Fixed

- Fixed use of `tobytes()` in `Task.message` for Django 2.0.

## [0.1.3] - 2017-11-20
### Added

- `--reload-use-polling` flag to force a poll-based file watcher
  instead of a OS-native one.  This is useful inside of Vagrant and
  Docker. ([Dramatiq #18])
